Info:
This uses font characters you define in png files in a font library. This gem comes with a limited set of characters 0-9, +, /, *, and - in a courier font. This can be overridden if you create a font library using the convention described below.

CaptchaFontLib Conventions:
When instantiating a font lib you specify a font name and a path to the lib. The path to the lib represents a directory above the directory that contains your font, e.g., if your font is FooSans, your dir structure would look like this:

~/myFonts/
    FooSans/
		   ...
		   cm_49.png
		   cm_50.png
		   cm_51.png
		   ...
Your library would also contain png files for each character to be used and would be named with cm_<ascii decimail rep>.png, e.g. your file for the number 3 would be cm_51.png. If you include a character in a string that is not represented in the font library, we raise a CaptchaFontException.
